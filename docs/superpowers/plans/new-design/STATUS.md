# New design restart: status

The single resume point for the engineering restart. Any fresh session resumes from this file
alone. Every step ends by updating this file and pushing it to main.

Controlling documents:
- Strategy (plan of plans): `docs/superpowers/2026-10-05-engineering-restart-strategy.md`
- Decision record: `docs/superpowers/decisions/2026-10-05-engineering-restart-log.md`
- Integration branch: `integration/new-design-r1` (worktree `../Pantas-wt-integration-new-design-r1`)

## Lock

State: free
Holder: none
Since: 2026-10-06 (released at the level 4 stop)

Rule: a run takes the lock by setting State to held with its start time, then pushes. If the lock
is held and younger than 2 hours, a run exits. A lock older than 2 hours is stale and may be
taken. Release it by setting State to free when the step ends.

## Current stage

Level 3 (strategy B5). Level 2 gate passed October 6, 2026.

## Waiting on Aedwon

Nothing.

## Next step

Level 4 under way. W0 done. Next: W1, W3 and W6 in parallel (`L3-parallel-map.md`). Aedwon's setup steps
before the tasks that need them: `level4-setup-steps.md` Parts 1 to 5 (store products, trial,
RevenueCat products, giveaway entitlements, Cloud Functions and Blaze, budget alerts, tester
allowlist, RevenueCat secret key). Still open for him: privacy text for the Pantas ID
(`drafts/privacy-pantas-id.md`); credit for the three reading-comprehension images; the Sanity
upload for lesson images; E14 risk acceptance at the end.
