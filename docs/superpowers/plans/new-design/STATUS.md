# New design restart: status

The single resume point for the engineering restart. Any fresh session resumes from this file
alone. Every step ends by updating this file and pushing it to main.

Controlling documents:
- Strategy (plan of plans): `docs/superpowers/2026-10-05-engineering-restart-strategy.md`
- Decision record: `docs/superpowers/decisions/2026-10-05-engineering-restart-log.md`
- Integration branch: `integration/new-design-r1` (worktree `../Pantas-wt-integration-new-design-r1`)

## Lock

State: free
Holder: none
Since: 2026-10-06 (released at the level 4 stop)

Rule: a run takes the lock by setting State to held with its start time, then pushes. If the lock
is held and younger than 2 hours, a run exits. A lock older than 2 hours is stale and may be
taken. Release it by setting State to free when the step ends.

## Current stage

Level 4 (building). Levels 1 to 3 passed their gates on October 6, 2026.

| Level 4: W4 screen families | W4a, W4b, W4c in progress; W4d started (no commit); W4e, W4f prepared; W4g not started. Contracts integrated so far: W4b Task 1 and `LessonDayContext` (ffc8045b) | web/new-design-w4[a-f]-r1; standing rulings in L3-parallel-map.md |
| Level 4: W6 backend hardening | Tasks 1 to 5c done and integrated (Task 5b, Oct 7); Tasks 6 to 8 (live rules snapshot, deploys, final) remain | integration/new-design-r1 at 739ccae1; gates/w6-astra-audit-1.md |

## Last completed step

W3 accepted and integrated (integration/new-design-r1 at 2d438daf, Oct 12). Lead-run checks on the
merged branch at aa9c0bfb: 3,858 Flutter tests, 84 plain and 92 emulator backend tests; Task 14c
after that changed only the index file and two tests, which pass. W0, W1, W2, W3, W6 Tasks 1 to 5c
and W4h Tasks 1, 2, 3, 5 are integrated.

## Running or scheduled (Oct 12, 7:30 PM)

- BLOCKED ON CODEX: at 7:25 PM Codex reported the weekly limit: "try again at Oct 18th, 2026
  12:58 PM". No Sol or Astra run is possible before then unless Aedwon adds credits or the limit is
  reset. Nothing is scheduled. Aedwon has been asked how to proceed (wait, add credits, or let
  Sonnet 5.5 continue Sol's unfinished families, which his Oct 10 rule forbids today).
- New commits from the 7:07 PM window (unreviewed, not integrated): W4c 287a640b (reading
  fraction contract); W4d 4ce76695 (Task 1 start functions) and a2a0cb80 (report entry).
- Uncommitted work sits in the worktrees of W4a (5 files), W4c (13), W4d (10), W4f (29, Task 1).
  Do not clean these worktrees.
- Integration branch 958ed879 is merged into every family branch. Session ids in `w<N>-sid`
  (lead scratchpad); resume prompts `w4x-resume.md`, `w4d-resume2.md`, `w4f-resume.md`,
  `w4b-resume2.md`, `w4e-resume.md`; runner `lane.sh HH:MM job...`.

## Next step

Review and integrate W4a and W4c when their workers finish. W4b, W4d, W4e, W4f and W4g also need W3 integrated (after its audit and fixes). Then W6
Tasks 6 to 8 and W3 Task 15 (deploys, each with Aedwon's approval and his setup steps), W2's
close-out, W4h Task 4, W5. Roles: strategy B7 (Sol builds; Sonnet only when Codex is used up and
only on work no Sol worker started; Astra audits; the reading tier runs checks and exact edits).
Waiting on Aedwon: setup steps (`level4-setup-steps.md`, now with two pass products), privacy text
(`drafts/privacy-pantas-id.md`), the Season Pass renewal line, confirmation of "Could not save your
progress.", a look at the component gallery on a device, image credits, the Sanity upload, E14.
