# New design restart: status

The single resume point for the engineering restart. Any fresh session resumes from this file
alone. Every step ends by updating this file and pushing it to main.

Controlling documents:
- Strategy (plan of plans): `docs/superpowers/2026-10-05-engineering-restart-strategy.md`
- Decision record: `docs/superpowers/decisions/2026-10-05-engineering-restart-log.md`
- Integration branch: `integration/new-design-r1` (worktree `../Pantas-wt-integration-new-design-r1`)

## Lock

State: free
Holder: none
Since: 2026-10-06 (released at the level 4 stop)

Rule: a run takes the lock by setting State to held with its start time, then pushes. If the lock
is held and younger than 2 hours, a run exits. A lock older than 2 hours is stale and may be
taken. Release it by setting State to free when the step ends.

## Current stage

Level 3 (strategy B5). Level 2 gate passed October 6, 2026.

## Waiting on Aedwon

Nothing.

## Next step

Abuse review amendment (Oct 6, `gates/abuse-review-1.md`): level 1 amended (strategy Part A rule,
B2 W3, W4g, W5, new W6). Next: level 2 amendments for W3, W4g, W5 and a new L2-W6, level 2 delta
gate; then level 3 amendments (W3, W4g, W5, new L3-W6, parallel map) and a level 3 delta gate.
Waiting on Aedwon for two product decisions: offline Pro after the paid period ends (lead: 3 days);
trial rule (lead: Play's "never had a subscription" rule). Level 4 start answers are recorded in the
decision record (Oct 6); store setup steps are in `level4-setup-steps.md`.
