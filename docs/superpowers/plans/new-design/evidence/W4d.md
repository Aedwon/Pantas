# W4d quiz evidence

## Assignment and policy

- Policy: origin/main `cb4dc3cecb5788e9036db24d41c7478aacc3638d`, fetched October 12, 2026. Read AGENTS.md, WORKFLOW.md, SUBAGENTS.md, the standing W4 rulings and the quiz plan's October 12 rulings.
- Product inputs: L3-W4d-quiz.md and L2-W4d-quiz.md on that main revision, all W4d traceability rows, the approved October 5 amendment, shared state-pattern contract, W2 October 10 contrast rulings, and design boards in the main checkout. Main checkout is read-only.
- Starting source: `958ed879`, branch `web/new-design-w4d-r1`, clean linked worktree. Integration already reached this branch, including W4e's MockCard. No previous W4d patch or commit was present.
- Authorization: October 5 restart applies to this design work. Other engineering pauses and main application-code freeze remain. Do not push or merge.
- Task order: 1, report contract/form from 7, then 2 through 9.
- Pre-flight shared interfaces: Task 1's lesson scope feeds Task 4; the report form feeds Tasks 4 and 6 and W4a; Task 4's checked outcomes feed Tasks 5 and 6. W4e's card is injected through the route layer, never imported by quiz presentation.
- Review and phone visual acceptance remain with the lead and Aedwon.

## Task 1: lesson and quick starts

Files:
- `lib/features/quiz/application/quiz_starts.dart`
- `lib/features/quiz/domain/use_cases/start_inline_lesson_quiz.dart`
- `test/features/quiz/domain/use_cases/start_inline_lesson_quiz_test.dart`

Public entry contracts: `startLessonQuiz(BuildContext context, LessonId lessonId, {required ExamId examId})` and `startQuickQuiz(BuildContext context, {required ExamId examId})`, both `Future<void>`. Each pushes the declared route, preserving the reader or Study return route. Inline selection filters on the W0 question lesson id before the existing five-question picker. A smaller lesson pool stays smaller; sibling questions never fill it.

Checks:
- Initial test load failed because ignored Freezed outputs were absent. Ran `dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs`: exit 0, wrote 2816 outputs. No generated files staged. Existing generator SDK-range and obsolete drift-option warnings reported; no dependency or configuration changes.
- RED: `flutter test test/features/quiz/domain/use_cases/start_inline_lesson_quiz_test.dart --reporter expanded`: exit 1, +3 -2. Three-question pool wrongly returned five; seven-question pool included a sibling.
- GREEN task checks: `flutter test test/features/quiz test/features/review_prompt test/app --reporter expanded`: exit 0, +459, All tests passed!
- Format: three affected Dart files, 0 changed.

## Contrast changes

None yet.

## Waiting on a contract

None yet.

## Open questions and remaining work

Tasks 2 through 9 remain. No backend report function exists; reports must remain queued until a sender is approved. No deployment is authorized.
- `flutter analyze lib test tool`: exit 1, `1 issue found. (ran in 8.3s)`. Only the existing bookmarks `onReorder` deprecation at line 238, explicitly assigned to W4c Task 8 and recorded as accepted in W2 evidence. Zero quiz findings.

Task 1 commit: `4ce766957304055116187b6008142abd05a59894`.

## Task 7 early contract: report entry, form and local queue

Files: `lib/features/quiz/data/report_queue.dart`, `lib/features/quiz/presentation/report_form.dart`, their tests, `lib/core/ui/components/floating_bar.dart`, and `test/core/ui/components/floating_bar_content_test.dart`.

Contract: `Future<bool?> openQuestionReport(BuildContext context, String questionId, {required ReportQueue queue})`. The caller passes `ReportQueue` built from its app database. True means the report was saved locally, allowing the caller to color its icon teal. Cancellation returns null. No feature-specific provider or viewer route is required by W4a.

Boards read through outline.py and timeline.py: QN_Report, QN_ReportOffline, QN_ReportAgain, QN_ReportLimit. Form: title 17/700, detail 13/400 at 1.4, field 16 at 1.4, insets 18/18/18/16, field radius 12, pill height 44, spacing 10. Shared FloatingBar gains a content constructor with configurable radius and inset, allowing the 24-radius form without a feature-local surface. Existing row interface stays intact. Extension test lives beside W2 tests.

The approved no-op sender retains every queued report. Until the backend exists, production success uses the board's truthful offline saved line, not a claim of delivery. Limits are atomic, 3 per question lifetime and 20 per local day. Blank text consumes no slot. Existing report copy is retained for the per-question limit, which has no separate drawn board. A failed save retains the text and uses the shared retry line. Focus node, text controller and close timer are disposed.

Checks:
- RED queue and form tests: exit 1, missing new ReportQueue, ReportForm and openQuestionReport contracts.
- First form run: +6 -1; entry test did not pump the changed input before tapping its still-disabled Send. Corrected the test's interaction sequence.
- Task checks: `flutter test --no-pub test/features/quiz test/features/review_prompt test/app test/core/ui/components/floating_bar_content_test.dart --reporter expanded`: exit 0, +467, All tests passed!
- Focus ownership added; rerun affected tests: `flutter test --no-pub test/features/quiz/data/report_queue_test.dart test/features/quiz/presentation/report_form_test.dart test/core/ui/components/floating_bar_content_test.dart --reporter expanded`: exit 0, +8, All tests passed!
- `flutter analyze --no-pub lib test tool`: exit 1, `1 issue found. (ran in 3.6s)`, only the accepted W4c bookmarks deprecation. Fixed every new lint.
- `dart run tool/check_layering.dart`: exit 0, `check_layering: OK`.
- `dart run tool/check_no_ai_attribution.dart`: exit 0, `check_no_ai_attribution: OK`.

Remaining Task 7 work: wire the icon into the live question and viewer screens in Tasks 4 and 6; verify their return animation and recoloring with those screens. No report backend is approved or deployed.
